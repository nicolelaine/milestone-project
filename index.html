                <p>"Map your Desire Path" is a collaborate project to put the Desire Paths you see in the world around you onto the map. A Desire Path is a path or way that forms when pedestrian and foot traffic wears away at the natural or urban landscape, often in a way that in contrary to land and urban planning. Desire Paths can show where the people "voted with their feet" and can be helpful in planning future cities. This project aims to help people notice the world around us, and to take a "people first" approach to the places where we live.</p>
